# James Stocker

Hello! I'm James (he/him), I'm an Operations Engineer, working for [Intent HQ](https://github.com/intenthq/) we're using tools like terragrunt, python and AWS resources.

I live in Barcelona with my 3-year-old son. I moved here from the UK in 2020 because I disagreed with the direction the country was heading after Brexit and felt that relocating was the best way to express my disapproval of the government.
